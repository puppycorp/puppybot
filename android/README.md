# PuppyBot Android App

This is a simple Android application for controlling PuppyBot. It currently only provides a bootstrap skeleton and includes three options:

1. **Bluetooth Control** – Intended to connect directly to the robot over Bluetooth.
2. **Connect to Server** – Connects to the bundled web server that lives in this repository.
3. **Host Server** – Runs a basic server from the phone so the bot can connect to it.

All features are placeholders and need implementation. To open the project in Android Studio use the `android` directory.
